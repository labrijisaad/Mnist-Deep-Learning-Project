# MNIST Deep Learning Project

## Overview ðŸš€
This repository explores the application of three distinct techniques using the MNIST dataset. Our primary objective is to assess the efficacy of supervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised learning methods.

## Techniques ðŸŽ¯
1. **Supervised Learning**
   - *Objective:* Train a model to recognize numbers using 100 MNIST examples.
   - *Approach:* Employ various methodologies to optimize model performance and utilize data augmentation to enhance the model's accuracy.

2. **Semi-Supervised Learning**
   - *Objective:* Enable the model to autonomously comprehend data without labeled guidance.
   - *Task:* Classify unlabeled MNIST data into distinct number groups and reconstruct the 10 classes of the target (label).

3. **Self-Supervised Learning**
   - *Objective:* Evaluate the independent performance of trained models.
   - *Significance:* Assess the model's ability to make accurate predictions without external guidance.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Deliverables
- **Supervised Learning:** Present the model's proficiency in recognizing numbers.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning:** Demonstrate the model's autonomous categorization of unlabeled data.
- **Self-Supervised Learning:** Evaluate the model's capability to operate independently.
